In the first delivery I thought that all the use cases had to be connected.
For instance, that the login use case had to be connected to another use case
that verify it, then that use case had to be extend multiple use cases to tell
them that the user was logged in. Of course this is erroneous and I realize now
that specific thing should have been replaced with a precondition.

Even now the programmer in me is bugging me to connect that 'Login' use case.
But that would turn into an ungodly mess.
