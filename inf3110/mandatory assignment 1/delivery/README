Compile:
javac Robol.java Main.java

Execute:
java Main


I don't know what this documentation is supposed to contain. The Robol 
interpreter is pretty straight forward, hence the lack of comments in the code.
The <stop> statement simply tells the robot to print its position on the grid,
the program would have stopped execution nonetheless. If the program tries to 
interpret a variable that hasn't been declared or the robot moves off the grid,
then the program print an error message and exits execution. 

Main.java contain the AST representations of the example programs.

I'm sorry about the poor interface (non-existing) during runtime. This
assignment took many more hours than necessary due to a side-effect error.
