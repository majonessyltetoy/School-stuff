Fun assignment this week. Excercise 4.3 was really too easy. 4.1 and 4.4 were
well written problems. The winnie.txt file is not a good input file because
the text is not hygenic. There are symbols and punctuation marks all over the
words. And on line 214 there are two words on one line (my program doesn't match
that line when counting "Winnie-the-Pooh"). However ignoring the input file,
the excercise was good.

Overall I used about 2 hours on excercise 4.1-4.4 and maybe 4 hours on 4.5
Most of the time spent was spent fooling around adding features and tweaking the
code. The assignment was the only programming I did this week hence the time
sunk into it.
