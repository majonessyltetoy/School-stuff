I wasn't able to finish in time. Turns out I had the wrong idea about the 
iterate() method from oblig6. Everything went smoothly until the *write to
file* and *perform statistics* that depended on being able to iterate.

Please note that the missing over could easily have been implemented had
it not been for the missing piece about iterating.
