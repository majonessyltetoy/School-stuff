I've come to hate Java error messages. Getting errors is normal, however when it
comes to decipher these vague archaic hints as to what the problem actually is,
then it can be anybodies guess. I won't go into details, but I wasted so many
hours try to correct what Java was complaining about (even though it was
correct). I probably used more than 15 hours on this assignment. There wasn't
anything particularly difficult.

There are some provisional classes (Legemidler, Leger, Resepter) included in the
delivery. This is because they are needed as dummy objects in the Test* classes.

If I could afford more time, then I'd make a superclass for iterating over the
lists and improved the TestUnit for exceptions.

Oh, and by the way, I never understood the importance of requiring the generic
objects to be subclass or implement the Lik class. I mean we already require
them to implement Comparable<T>. It kinda seem redundant to extend Lik too.

I didn't have time for 6.1b (started in the morning 16.03), drawing objects with
arrays with objects that contain objects that are connected to other objects
took more time than I thought it would.
