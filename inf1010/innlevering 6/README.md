This delivery has been corrected, and the grade is: 6/6 (passed)
Let me state one thing outright: you are completely, wholly and utterly wrong on the subject of Java error messages; they are beautiful snowflakes and you should love them like family.

...you'll understand why when you start coding in C.

Besides that, though, besides that...I agree with you completely on the Lik interface; it just plain sucks. I'm not too bothered about 6.1b because usually, the complexity of the drawing grows out of hand with a system of this scope, defeating the entire point. Regarding what you wish you could have implemented, what you describe shows that you have the right idea, though it seems you haven't quite got the hang of iterators yet.

The various List and Table classes range from good to excellent; in particular, the sorted list insert is elegant. You are, as I said, missing a proper iterator, however, and it's quite conceivable that you might want a List of elements that aren't comparable to one another; in this case, you'd want separate Node classes.

The tests are very good, as well.
