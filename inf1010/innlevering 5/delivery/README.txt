This assignment was actually fun! Sometimes it's healthy to have a small assign-
ment, instead of the usual ~10 files chaos. It took 10 min to mentally visualize
what had to be done 20 to write it and 30 minutes to go over everything and test
that it's working as it should. Overall a little bit more than an hour.
