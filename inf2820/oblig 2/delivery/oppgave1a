lancaster.stem('splitting') -> 'splitting'
porter.stem('splitting')    -> 'split'

In my implementation of Lancaster stemming, I get an erroneous stemming:
lancaster.stem('splitting') -> 'splitting'
this is strange because Lancaster stemming is often more aggressive than Porter.

Example:
word: advancing
port: advanc
lanc: adv

On http://smile-stemmer.appspot.com/ we get the expected behavior from both
Porter and Lancaster: 'splitting' -> 'split'.

In this exercise with my results, I have to say Lancaster stemming does not stem
'splitting' while Porter does.
